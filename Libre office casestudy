Abstract: This case study explores LibreOffice, a widely used open-source office suite. It delves into the developmental models, licensing strategies, mode of funding, and the diverse spectrum of commercial and non-commercial applications of LibreOffice. This study provides insights into the dynamics of a successful open-source software project.Developmental Models: LibreOffice follows a community-driven developmental model. It emerged as a fork of the OpenOffice.org project, with a focus on creating a fully open-source and community-driven office suite. Developers, designers, and volunteers worldwide collaborate to enhance LibreOffice's features, fix bugs, and ensure compatibility with various platforms. This model emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and democratic decision-making.Licensing: LibreOffice is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPLv2) and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3). These licenses guarantee that LibreOffice remains free and open-source software. Users have the freedom to study, modify, and distribute the software. The licensing choice aligns with the principles of software freedom and encourages widespread adoption and collaboration.Mode of Funding: The Document Foundation, the organization behind LibreOffice, relies on a combination of funding sources. It actively seeks donations from individuals, institutions, and businesses that value LibreOffice's role in promoting open access to office productivity tools. Commercial companies also contribute through offering support and services around LibreOffice, providing financial stability to the project.Commercial/Non-Commercial Use: LibreOffice serves a broad range of users in both commercial and non-commercial sectors. Many businesses and government agencies adopt LibreOffice as a cost-effective alternative to proprietary office suites, reducing software licensing costs. Educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and individuals also benefit from LibreOffice's free and open nature, making it a valuable tool for diverse applications.
